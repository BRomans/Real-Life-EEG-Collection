## Random Clicks Experiment

Script that enables high quality EEG data collection by triggering clicks in random intervals and recording brain activiy before and after the stimuli.

### Idea

Inducing a specific mental state can be challenging and time-consuming. This led me to consider, 'why not to trigger a frustration while playing League of Legends?' I will just troll the player in random intervals and record the brain activity before and after the stimuli. Surely, the player won't be happy about that. But that's the point. I want to see how the brain reacts to the frustration.


### Usage

```shell
python ./random_clicks.py  --random_range=8,30,2 --key=d --filename=lol
```

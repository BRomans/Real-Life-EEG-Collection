## Real-life EEG Data Collection

### Motivation

Inducing a specific mental state can be challenging and time-consuming. The goal of this project is to collect numerous small samples of high-quality data from real-life scenarios. This approach aims to make experiments more reliable and seamles


#### [In-game Trigger](./RandomClicks/README.md)
'Why not to trigger a frustration while playing League of Legends?' This is a tool for trolling the player at random intervals and recording their brain activity before and after the stimuli. Surely, the player won't be happy about that. But that's the point. I want to see how the brain reacts to the frustration.

*Tested on League of Legends, but can be used in any other game. Please note that the program may be detected as a cheat and you may get banned.*


#### Background Recorder (soon to be released)
This tool combines screen, camera, and EEG recording capabilities. It allows for the collection, and subsequent selection, of EEG data in the background while you watch a movie, play a game, work, or study.
